Here are some examples of action plans based on different modules already encountered on programs.

## WCAG Translation

A WCAG translation could be an official initiative launched with W3C accreditation, but this would require significant investment. A lighter idea would be to focus the work on building a strong community in the country. But even if an unofficial initiative is launched, the revision methodology must follow the same path as the official W3C one. 

Example of actions: 

 * Search for resources in the field and Contact different partners
 * Build a core team & find a community leader
 * Write a simple schedule
 * Create a github organization
 * Defining a reasonable perimeter with concrete goals

## The general Assessment
 
Example of actions:

 * Select a website panel in different sector
 * Initiate a spreadsheet and collect automated data and this panel
 * Determine a sample of pages (as connection page, contact) and make a quick audit on it.
 * Reproduce the same procedure on the whole panel every six month
