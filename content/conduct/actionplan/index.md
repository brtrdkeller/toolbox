title: Action plan

Here are some examples of action plans based on different modules already encountered on programs.

## WCAG Translation

A WCAG translation could be an official initiative launched with W3C accreditation, but this would require significant investment. A lighter idea would be to focus the work on building a strong community in the country. But even if an unofficial initiative is launched, the revision methodology must follow the same path as the official W3C one. 

### Example of actions : 

 * Search for resources in the field and contact various partners
 * Set up a core team and find a community leader
 * Draft a simple program
 * Create a github organization
 * Define a reasonable scope with concrete objectives

### Example of actions:

 * Select a panel website in different sectors
 * Initiate a spreadsheet and collect automated data from this panel
 * Determine a sample of pages (e.g. login page, contact) and perform a quick audit on it.
 * Reproduce the same procedure on the entire panel every six months.

### An evaluation of the service provider

### Example of actions:

* Select one or two representative suppliers and try to convince them to make improvements.
* Introduce the importance of an improvement strategy.
* Launch a technical audit and a survey of the platform's users.
* Train staff
* Push for technical improvements
* Renew a technical audit and user survey for this platform
